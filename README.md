# small-websites-with-no-styling

I wanted to have a place for all of my small website projects that I made while I was (still am) learning HTML

These websites do not have any css or javascript attached to them, it is all purely HTML

I used the free full-stack certification that freecodecamp.org made to guide my learning.
