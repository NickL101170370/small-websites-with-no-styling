        <h1>The Original Markiplier FNAF playthrough (1-3)</h1>
        <p>Markiplier (self-acclaimed "King of Five Night's at Freddy's") has been playing FNAF since the original game came out in 2014. Even now, 11 years later, FNAF games are still being made, and Markiplier is always one of the first ones to play them.</p>

            <h2>The First Episode</h2>
            <p>Ahhh, the original. This kicks off Mark's love for FNAF, even though he only knows Freddy's name.</p>

            <h2>The Second Episode</h2>
            <p>Mark's getting more into it, now. He's learning names, the routines of the animatronics, he's getting better. This is the episode he gets the rarest jumpscare in the game: Golden Freddy.</p>

            <h2>The Third Episode</h2>
            <p>Still not great at the game, still entirely terrified at every jumpscare. But that's what makes it good, right?</p>
